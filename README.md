## My process

### Built with

- HTML 
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I understand even more the use of max-width, and to make the main container properly centered and responsive by using transform:translate, though I 
still have not fully grasped the use of it I will study it on my next projects.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
